# Getting Started with Solana frontend

Template for creating a Solana Dapp.
This is just boilerplate code and everything will have to be written by the user afterwards. Its just a way to get started without having to write all the config yourself.
This uses typescript and React.

yarn install to install the libraries, and yarn start to run.

It includes some stuff that I like, like tailwind and zustand.

Feel free to make a pull request if you feel like you can improve this boilerplate for others.
